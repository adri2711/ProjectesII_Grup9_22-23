Be it Geometry, Time, logical structures, molecules or language, there is nothing unable to be touched by its Grace. Symmetry is the expression of a permanent essence, and thus the proof of the entwinement of the supranatural plane with mundane phenomena. Search for its signs. Feel the ecstasy of Perfection.",
